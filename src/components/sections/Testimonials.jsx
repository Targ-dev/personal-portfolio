                My interest in web development began long ago, but due to some
                circumstances, I initially worked in non-tech roles like sales,
                customer service, and business operations. These roles taught me
                valuable soft skills like communication, teamwork, and
                adaptability â€” but I always felt drawn to the tech world.
              </div>
              <div className="mb-4">
                In 2024, I made the decision to seriously pursue a career in
                development. I enrolled in a MERN Stack course and committed
                myself to hands-on learning. Since then, I've been building
                projects, improving my understanding of front-end and back-end
                technologies, and staying consistent in my growth.
              </div>
              <div>
                Now, I'm actively looking for internships or entry-level
                developer positions where I can continue learning, contribute
                meaningfully, and grow within a team. This career switch is a
                step I've taken with clarity and confidence, and I'm excited
                about the journey ahead.
